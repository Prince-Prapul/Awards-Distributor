# Simple Certificates System :trophy:

Simple award certificate distribution system with a personalized link per recipient. Recipients can view their certificate on the website or download it as a PDF. The website verifies the certificate by using the hash of the URL parameters; making it more difficult to forge/modify a certificate URL.
